  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>This Implementation Guide has been developed by the Vulcan UDP Project (Utilizing the Digital
    Protocol). </p>
  <p>The content is based on FHIR R6. This is to take advantage of new features in the <a
      href="https://hl7.org/fhir/6.0.0-ballot4/researchstudy.html">ResearchStudy</a> resource. There
    will be backports to earlier FHIR releases in future. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>What is a clinical study protocol?</strong> Conduct of clinical studies is guided by
    the International Council for Harmonization of Technical (ICH) Requirements for Human Use,
    Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) E6 which specifies the protocol as “A document that
    describes the objective(s), design, methodology, statistical considerations and organisation of
    a trial,” incorporating all aspects of what is needed to define how the study is to be conducted
    and reviewed. The protocol should provide background and rationale for the study, highlight the
    specific research questions to be addressed, and take into consideration ethical issues. It
    describes the objectives, design, methodology, statistical considerations and other aspects
    related to the organization of the clinical study.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Who can benefit from utilizing a digital protocol?</strong> Users of protocols exist
    across the full continuum of clinical and translational research. Traditional research conducted
    by the biopharmaceutical industry involves complex processes with numerous opportunities for
    automation(See Use Case Opportunities, Present and Future).</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Why FHIR?</strong> FHIR adoption in healthcare has expanded rapidly in recent years.
    (See The State of FHIR in 2025). FHIR-based exchange of protocols will enable their use within
    healthcare systems, helping to bridge clinical research and care and to facilitate translational
    research. Emerging applications of FHIR in regulated clinical research include exchange of
    electronic Product Information and PQ-CMC documentation. Leveraging FHIR for protocol exchange
    enables regulators and sponsors to reuse infrastructure across content types, improving
    efficiency and consistency. As an open, web-based interoperability standard, FHIR supports
    exchange of both structured and unstructured data exchange without proprietary limitations and
    is backed by a global community. Finally, FHIR will enable innovating on innovative automated
    exchange of ICH M11. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Why ICH M11?</strong> It reflects a consensus-driven effort led by global regulatory
    authorities and industry experts to standardize clinical trial protocols. Regulatory agencies
    have played a central role in shaping both the protocol template and related specifications,
    ensuring alignment with their expectations for structured, electronic submissions. As a result,
    ICH M11 is expected to be incorporated into regulatory guidelines, making its adoption a strong
    driver for global harmonization and a likely requirement for future protocol submissions. In
    addition, it is aligned to USDM which is further into the implementation phase. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Why USDM?</strong> The Unified Study Definition Model provides a standardized, highly
    detailed model for articulating protocol and related study information in a machine-readable
    manner. It incorporates all structured elements of ICH M11 and additional elements (e.g.,
    information used for clinical trial execution, reporting, etc.). USDM development was strongly
    guided by sponsor subject matter experts and shaped through public standards-setting processes.
    It is now being adopted by numerous biopharmaceutical companies across a range of sponsor-driven
    use cases.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Why <a href="https://hl7vulcan.org/">Vulcan</a>?</strong> The Vulcan HL7 FHIR
    Accelerator aims to bridge research and clinical care through the use of FHIR, strategically
    connecting collaborators to maximize expertise and efforts. Vulcan members include implementers,
    sponsors, academic research, government representatives who are working on or have interests in
    protocol digitization. The Vulcan Utilizing the Digital Protocol (UDP) is an umbrella project
    integrating related work being developed by ICH M11, CDISC, and TransCelerate to enable
    compatible, standards-based exchange of ICH M11-aligned clinical trial protocols across research
    stakeholders including sponsors, sites and regulators.</p>

  <h3>Technical Overview</h3>
  <p>This Implementation Guide describes the representation of a protocol in FHIR format aligned
    with the ICH M11 CeSHarP Template, Guideline, and Technical Specification. This initial version
    of the IG is focused primarily on exchange of protocols as traditional "documents", i.e.,
    narrative text, with only some elements exchanged as structured content. An approach which
    enables more digital structuring of elements aligned to M11 is addressed by USDM, the developed
    by CDISC in partnership with TransCelerate as part of Digital Data Flow initiative. Future
    versions this IG are intended to expand integration of USDM and FHIR in order to enable exchange
    of additional structured protocol content in FHIR-based systems. As additional IGs may be
    developed for specific use cases which this IG serving as the base or core. Both M11 and USDM
    are represented in the FHIR Representation mapping spreadsheet (found under <a
      href="downloads.html">Downloads</a> section of the banner).</p>
  <p> The key FHIR resources used are <a
      href="https://hl7.org/fhir/6.0.0-ballot4/researchstudy.html">ResearchStudy</a> and <a
      href="https://hl7.org/fhir/6.0.0-ballot4/composition.html">Composition</a>, while also drawing
    on some patterns found in profiles and extensions from the <a
      href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ebm/en/index.html">EBM IG</a>. EBM utilizes protocol
    elements to be able to review and reporting on research completed; UDP will include ICH M11
    related items. </p>
  <p> For more description of the relationship between the resources, extensions and profiles see
    the FHIR Representation section and the actual specifications in the Artifacts section.</p>


  <a name="objectives"> </a>
  <h3>Core Objectives </h3>
  <p>The Vulcan UDP project enables digital protocol exchange through FHIR, supporting Vulcan&#39;s
    mission to connect clinical and translational research to clinical care. The main goal of this
    FHIR Implementation Guide is to developed iteratively concentrating first on near-term
    achievable use cases to ensure immediate impact and feasibility, while building foundations for,
    and avoiding blockers to, long-term use cases. The overarching vision is for compatibility
    across clinical research stakeholders. </p>
  <p>The future Governance processes must ensure retaining alignment with ICH M11 and compatible
    standards of CDISC USDM and Controlled Terminology as well as related uses of FHIR such as those
    in the Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) Implementation Guide. Successful governance will require
    active participation in HL7 processes to ensure long-term alignment with related efforts such as
    EBM, and with other organizations, such as ICH M11, CDISC, and TransCelerate.</p>


  <a name="scope"> </a>
  <h3>Scope </h3>
  <p>
    <strong>In Scope</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The initial use case addressed within this version is FHIR-based exchange of M11-aligned
    protocols between sponsors and regulators, as driven by ICH M11(Clinical electronic Structured
    Harmonized Protocols, or CeSHarP). Development was approached to 1) leverage and enable
    compatibility with related standards where possible and 2) in such a way as to accommodate
    future use cases. For example, work to align with CDISC USDM is ongoing and viewed as a
    near-term pathway to expanding delivered use cases.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Out of scope</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for any non-ICH M11 aligned protocol exchange in this IG version. The future aim is
      to develop a use case roadmap, consider the broad spectrum of potential use cases of digital
      protocols and identify opportunities to establish foundational connections. (See also the <a
        href="use-cases.html">Use Cases and Workflow</a> section for some discussion on this).</li>
    <li>Detailed governance processes will be addressed in future iterations. </li>
