  <h3>Technical Overview</h3>
  <p>This guide describes the representation of a Study Protocol in FHIR format.  The Document focus of protocol 
    organization is provided by the ICH M11 CeSHarP Template and Technical Guide.  For a more structured approach 
    to the data there is the CDISC USDM model. Both are represented in the FHIR Representation mapping spreadsheet, 
    but for this version of the iG the emphasis is on the M11 approach.</p>

  <p>The key FHIR resources used are ResearchStudy and Composition and we also draw on some profiles and extension from the EBM IG.</p>

  <p>For more description of the releationship between the resources, extensions and profiles see the FHIR Representation section and 
    the actual specifications in the Artifacts section</p>

  <h3>Core Objectives </h3>
  <p>The Vulcan HL7 FHIR Accelerator aims to bridge research and clinical care through use of FHIR,
    strategically connecting collaborators to maximize expertise and efforts. The Vulcan Utilizing
    the Digital Protocol (UDP) project enhances the integration of clinical and translational
    research with clinical care by enabling digital protocol exchange through FHIR, supporting
    Vulcan's mission to connect these domains and research integration into care.</p>
  

  <blockquote>
  <p><em>Conduct of Clinical Trials is guided by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) E6. Core to this is the Clinical Protocol, a document intended to describe the objectives, design, methodology, statistical considerations and other aspects related to the organization of the clinical trial.</em></p>
  <p><em>Clinical protocols provide the background and rationale for conducting a study, highlighting specific research questions that are addressed, and taking into consideration ethical issues.</em> </p>
  <p><em>The clinical protocol incorporates all the aspects of what is needed to define how the study is to be conducted and reviewed.</em></p>
  </blockquote>

    <p>This Implementation Guide (IG) allows for FHIR-based exchange of digital clinical trial
    protocols aligned to ICH M11 (Clinical electronic Structured Harmonized Protocols, or CeSHarP)
    in a manner compatible across clinical research stakeholders. In the long term, this will require 
    alignment with other uses of FHIR and compatibility of FHIR with standards and terminologies used 
    in various sectors and environments (i.e. CDISC USDM). The specific initial use case
    addressed within this version is exchange between sponsors and regulators, while building foundations for, and
    avoiding blockers to, additional use cases that benefit the multiple stakeholders who utilize
    protocol information.</p>

  <h3>Scope </h3>
  <p>The Vulcan UDP project enables digital protocol exchange through FHIR, supporting Vulcan's
    mission to connect clinical and translational research to clinical care. The main goal of this
    FHIR Implementation Guide is to concentrate on near-term achievable use cases to ensure
    immediate impact and feasibility, while building foundations for, and avoiding blockers to,
    long-term cross-stakeholder compatibility across many additional use cases. Governance
    requirements include retaining alignment with ICH M11 and compatible standards of CDISC USDM and
    Controlled Terminology as well as related uses of FHIR such as those in the 
    <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ebm/history.html" > Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) </a> Implementation Guide.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>In Scope</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The initial use case focuses on <strong>sponsor-to-regulator exchange of protocols which align
    to ICH M11</strong>, leveraging and enabling compatibility with related standards where
    possible, and building cross-organization relationships to enable future governance. </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Out of scope</strong>
  </p>
  <p>While out of scope for this version of the Implementation Guide, the future aim is to develop a
    use case roadmap, considering the broad spectrum of potential use cases of digital protocols and
    seeking opportunities to establish foundational connections. (See also the Use Cases and Workflows section). </p>
  <p>Detailed governance processes are also out of scope for this version but will be addressed in
    future iterations. Successful governance will require active participation in HL7 processes to
    ensure long-term alignment with related efforts such as EBM, and with other organizations, such
    as ICH M11, CDISC, and TransCelerate.</p>
